## INTRODUCTION

The [Delta icons](https://delta-icons.github.io/) module provider for UI Icons.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules for further
information.

Download [Delta icons for Android](https://github.com/Delta-Icons/android) and
extract in this module only folder `resources/vectors`.

So your folder structure is:

```
└── vectors
  └── figma
  └── launcher_icons
  └── *.svg
```
