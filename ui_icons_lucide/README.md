## INTRODUCTION

The [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) module provider for UI Icons.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules for further
information.

### Option 1

Install [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/main/packages/lucide-static) in this module.

```shell
npm i lucide-static
```

So your folder structure is:

```

    └── icons
```
