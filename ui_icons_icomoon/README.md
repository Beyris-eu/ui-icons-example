## INTRODUCTION

The IcoMoon module provider for UI Icons.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules for further
information.

Download [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/library) selection as svg in
your libraries folder under Drupal web directory.
Place each package in it's own package name folder that will be used as group.

So your folder structure is:

libraries
  └── icomoon
      └── _PACKAGE_NAME_
        └── SVG
            └── ...svg files
