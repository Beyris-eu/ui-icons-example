## INTRODUCTION

The IcoMoon module provider for UI Icons.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules for further
information.

Download [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/library) selection as svg in
this module.
Place each package in it's own package name folder that will be used as group.

So your folder structure is:

```
icomoon
  └── _PACKAGE_NAME_
    └── ...svg files
```
