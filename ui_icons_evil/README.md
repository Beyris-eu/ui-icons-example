## INTRODUCTION

The [Evil icons](https://evil-icons.io) module provider for UI Icons.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules for further
information.

This module will allow access to some Drupal core icons.

Download [Evil icons](https://github.com/evil-icons/evil-icons/releases) and
extract in this module the folder `assets > icons`.

So your folder structure is:

```
icons
  └── *.svg
```
